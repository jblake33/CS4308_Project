# CS4308 Project
An interpreter (scanner, parser, and interpreter) for simplified Julia in C#

<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project
This was created for the class CS4308 - Concepts of Programming Languages at Kennesaw State University, under the supervision of Prof. Sharon Perry.

The program provides an in-depth illustration the tokens produced in the scanner, the grammar structure in the parser, and the output of the program in the interpreter. 

The simplified form of Julia includes if statements, assignment statements, while statements, print statements and repeat statements. It handles boolean and arithmetic expressions.
